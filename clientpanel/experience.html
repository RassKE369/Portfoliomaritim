          <h3>Software Engineering Intern [SafetyPlus Consoltancy]</h3>
          <p class="muted">June 2025 to August 2025</p>
          <p>During my internship, I had the chance to work on different projects
             that really helped me grow as a developer. I helped design and develop 
             company websites, worked on integrating Safaricom’s Daraja API for payment 
             processing, and created automation scripts to make some tasks faster and more 
             efficient. One of the highlights for me was building an automated receipt maker 
             system that made handling transactions much smoother.
             <br>
             <br>
              I also got to be part of the creative side of things — editing short marketing videos, 
              designing posters, and collaborating with the team on tech-driven marketing content. 
              We even worked together to create company portals that made internal processes more 
              organized. The experience taught me a lot about teamwork, communication, and how to 
              apply technical skills to real business challenges.</p>

              <h3>Cyber Café Assistant [ByFaith]</h3>
          <p class="muted">2022 to 2023</p>
          <p>My journey in tech started at a local cyber café, where I got 
            hands-on experience helping people with all sorts of digital and 
            technical services. I handled everything from government applications — 
            like KRA registration and filing, police good conduct, eCitizen services, 
            e-Government procurement (IFMIS and AGPO), NHIF, NSSF, HELB, NTSA, and passport 
            processing — to everyday document work.

            <br>
            <br>

            I spent a lot of time typing, editing, formatting, typesetting, converting 
            files, and working with PDFs — merging, splitting, and cleaning them up to 
            look professional. I also did design work for posters, banners, and business 
            cards, and handled technical setups like configuring internet connections, 
            installing software, and troubleshooting hardware.

            <br>
            <br>

            That experience taught me patience, problem-solving, and how to handle 
            different customer needs. It also gave me the foundation and confidence 
            that eventually inspired me to dive deeper into software engineering and system development.</p>
