      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My tech journey began in a small local cyber café, where I learned the 
        basics of technology through real, hands-on work. From helping clients with 
        eCitizen and KRA services to designing posters and troubleshooting computers, 
        I discovered how much I enjoyed solving problems and making tech work for people.
 <br>
 <br>
         After my time at Cyber Staff, I joined Kirinyaga University to pursue 
         Software Engineering, driven purely by passion and curiosity. I wanted 
         to understand how the tools I’d been using were built — and how I could 
         create my own. That decision completely changed how I see technology and 
         the impact it can have.
<br>
<br>
          Today, I’m focused on growing as a software developer, exploring web 
          development, automation, and creative tech projects. I love blending 
          design and code to build practical, user-friendly solutions — and I’m 
          always excited to learn, collaborate, and create something new!</p>
